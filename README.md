# Masters Project

This repo contains all the code used in my Masters Project. The code for each side, plus the code used to make an IOT air pollution sensor can be found in the zipped CODE folder.

Side 1 contains the js sketch used to make an interactive generative viusalisation that reacts to live air pollution data. It includes the arduino code that sends data to the laptop over Serial, plus the p5.js sketch used to make the visualisation.

Side 2 contains R code that was used to reproject the location data to a new co-ordinate reference system. It then contains the python code used to process the data into a format that kepler.gl can handle.

Side 3 contains the p5.js sketch used to make the visualisation of different emission sources from car parts.

Side 4 contains the p5.js sketch used to make the visualisation of the variable height density of air pollution.

IOT sensor contains the arduino code used to make an IOT air pollution sensor
